# Gila Backend

This is the backend code for the Gila app.  It has been deployed to AWS Lambda. That cost and the Rinkeby used to pay for gas are provided by the Tableland Network.  In theory this could include a paywall based on a Smart Contract deployed to the EVM network of the owner's choosing.  This type of architecture has a potential two-fold benefit for all involved parties.

1. There is an incentive for someone to develop and maintain the app.  This has a "shallow moat" that could encourage a market for apps that enable viewing a user's Gila data.
2. The user's of the app own their data and they can use a different implementation of the "backend" if they so choose.
