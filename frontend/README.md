# Gila, (desert woodpecker)

This is the frontend for the Gila app.  It's built with Nuxt 3 which is still very much in beta.  Because of this the static site generation isn't possible yet.  To use this app you can clone this repo and then run the server locally, once static site generation is supported Tableland will host this via IPFS and Textile Hub.

To start locally:

```
cd gila/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
